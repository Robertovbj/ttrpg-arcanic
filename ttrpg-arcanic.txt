Okay, currency and inventory, and trading them between characters
stats, hx, harm, moves, special moves, improvement.

About inventory:
	i think gear and equipment are the only distinctions - things you use vs things you wear, tho because of the survival aspect maybe a simple “backpack” for mundane things like food, water, medical supplies.

About HX:
	hx is basically a measure of how well you know someone
	the only info really needed is the name of the character and the number ( -4 to +4 ) of hx with that character
	It also should automaticaly reset to HX+1 if it reaches Hx+4 or Hx-4 with another character

About harm countdown:
	its a little confusing lol, i think they wanted to be poetic with the “countdown to death” idea. 

	for each harm you take you mark a section of the clock 

	1 harm is 12am to 3am
	2  is 3-6
	3 is 6-9
	4 is 9-10
	5 is 10-11
	6 is 11-12 

	if the clock is filled you die
	harm before 6 heals by itself 

	harm after 9 gets worse with time unless stabilized, im not sure if theres a way to add color in anyway but maybe a distinction for that would be nice
	
	im not sure what you mean by a harm counter without one of the effects. there is d-harm, s-harm, and Ψ-harm, but those are mostly just descriptors for the type of harm taken/why its being taken. effects like crippled are more like conditions affecting a character, they can be short or long term. [meaning is kinda like normal dmg, and conditions are optional

About improvement:
	for improvement, the space before is for marking, you can only have each improvement once.

About highlight:
	you have two highlighted stats, usually in campaigns the mc chooses one and then another player chooses the other. since this is a larger came i will choose one and then the player themself will choose the other. you get to mark an xp every time you roll with a highlighted stat.
